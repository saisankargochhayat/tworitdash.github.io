    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After watching the three chronicles of Narnia, I was curiously driven to know more about the writer C.S. Lewis. If I knew about the series before, I would have read the books much earlier than the release date of the first movie. I was a bit late to start, but it turned out to be more interesting than expected. I am a kind of person who take interest in some things which are not so mainstream and not adorable. As far as childrens&#8217; fantasy is concerned, I believe in &lsquo;em to some extent. But to think of a pretty different world in a different universe, (with a complete set of new physical laws and or you can say a complete set of new Gods of creation) has grown an immense inquisitiveness within me and for that very reason I found the Narnian series to be the best fit for my childish ( if you can say it ) imaginations. Is our world round or we just imagine it to be? Whatever that is, I found a world which is triangular flat in my dreams and happened to notice that Narnia is also flat.</p>

<p>And who knows the shape of the world we live in? (&hellip; Bermuda Triangle is still a mystery &hellip;) Things, which are untrue and apocryphal (or we just think they are) often trouble us about their existance, because those are somehow parts of our possible imaginations. The thing that I am trying to convey is nothing is apocryphal as long as they are parts of our imaginations. From physicsist&rsquo;s point of view, if I consider, I can say those things or happenings belong to other parallel universes. But the thing that I had to focus on was “How to make a contact(physical, mental, over internet if you are ignorant of the keyword “parallel universes”) among those parallel universes ?” I think (genuinely) that I certainly found out the answer and I believe C.S. Lewis had got it much before me .!! :)</p>
